They had eaten with no light on the table and the old an took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.
> 余：他们用餐时，桌上没有灯光，老人也在暗中脱裤上床。他把报纸夹在裤子里，卷起来做个枕头。他用毯子裹住身体，睡在铺着旧报纸的弹簧床上。不久他便睡去，梦见少年时去过的非洲，梦见漫长的金色海岸和白得刺眼的海岸，还有高耸的海岬、褐色的大山。

> 张：他们刚才吃饭，桌上并没有点灯。老人脱掉长袴，在黑暗中上床。他把袴子卷成一卷当作枕头，中间塞着报纸。他把毯子裹在身上，睡在垫在床上钢丝上的旧报纸上面。他很快就睡熟了，他梦见非洲，在他还是个孩子的时候；还有些长长的金色的海滩，和那白色的海滩，白得耀眼，和那崇高的海岬，和棕色的大山。

He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning. Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
> 余：如今他夜夜重回那岸旁，在梦中听见波涛拍岸，又看见土人的小舟来去乘潮。他嗅到甲板上柏油和麻绳的气味，还有清晨陆上微风送来的非洲气息。平时他每逢嗅到那陆上的微风，便起来穿衣，去唤醒男孩。可是今夜陆上微风的气息来得太早，他在梦中也知道是太早，便继续做梦，梦见群岛的白峰从海底涌起，又梦见加那利群岛各式各样的港湾和近海的泊站。

> 张：他现在天天晚上住在那海岸上，在他的梦里他听见海涛的吼声，看见土人的小船破浪而来。他睡梦中嗅到甲板上焦油和碎绳的气味，他也嗅到非洲的气味，早晨陆地上吹来的风带来的。他通常都是一嗅到陆地上吹来的风就醒了，穿上衣服就去把孩子叫醒。但是今天夜里那陆地上吹来的风来得非常早，他在梦里也知道是太早，就继续做梦，看见群岛的白色尖顶从海中突出来，然后他梦见加那利群岛的各个海口和碇泊所。

He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.
> 余：他不再梦见狂风暴雨，或者女人，或者大场面，或者巨鱼，或者拳赛，或者角力，或者亡妻。如今他只梦见各种地方和岸上的狮子。狮子在暮色里像小猫一样地嬉戏，而他就像爱那男孩一样地爱它们。他从未梦见那男孩。他就这么醒来，透过敞开的门凝望晓月，又抖开裤子穿上。他在屋外小便罢，便一路走上坡去，唤醒男孩。

> 张：他现在不再梦见风暴了，也不梦见女人，也不梦见什么大事，或是大鱼，或是打架，或是角力，也不梦见他的妻。他现在只梦见各种地方，还有海滩上的狮子。它们像年轻的猫一样在黄昏中游戏，他爱它们就像他爱那孩子一样。他从来不梦见那孩子。他就这么醒过来了，门开着，他向门外望了望月亮，把卷着的袴子摊开来，穿上去。他在小屋外面溺了泡尿，然后沿着路走上去叫醒那孩子。

He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing. The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.
> 余：晓寒里他索索发抖。可是他知道这么抖着就会发暖，而且马上就要划船了。男孩住屋的大门没有下锁，他便开门，赤着脚悄悄走进去。男孩熟睡在第一间房里的小床上；借着落月透进来的清光，老人一眼就看到他。他轻轻地握住一只脚不放，直到男孩醒来，转身望他。老人点点头，男孩便提起床边椅上的裤子，坐在床上，穿上裤子。

> 张：他在清晨的寒冷中颤抖着。但是他知道抖一会就会暖和的。而且他不久就要划船了。
孩子住的房子，门没有上闩，他开了门，静静地走进去，赤着脚。孩子在第一间房里睡在一张小床上，月亮就要落下去了，月光照进来，老人可以很清楚看见他。他温柔地握住一只脚，一直握着它，直到那孩子醒过来，翻过身来向他望着。老人点点头，孩子就从床旁边一张椅子上把他的长袴拿下来，坐在床上把袴子套上去。

The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry." "Que'va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do." They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats. When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.
> 余：老人走出门外，男孩跟他出去。他睡意仍浓，老人便搂着他的肩头说：“对不起。”“哪里话，”男孩说，“男子汉应该这样。”他们一路向老人的小屋走去。昏暗中，沿路都有赤脚的渔人掮着自己的船桅走动。到了老人的小屋，男孩拿起盛绳圈的箱子和鱼钩鱼叉，老人便掮着卷有布帆的船桅。
> 张：老人走出门去，孩子跟着他出来了。他还瞌睡，老人把手臂搁在他肩膀上，说:「我很抱歉。」「那有什么呢？」孩子说。「活总是要干的。」他们顺着路往下走，到老人的小屋去；一路上，在黑暗中，有许多赤着脚的人在那里移动，扛着他们船上的桅杆。他们走到老人的小屋里，孩子拿了篮子，里面装着一卷卷钓丝，还有鱼叉鱼钩；布帆卷在桅杆上，老人把桅杆扛在肩膀上。
