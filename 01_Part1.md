# Part 1
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week.

他是一个独自驾小船在海湾流捕鱼的老人，出发了84天一无所获。在最初的40天里，有一个男孩曾与他为伴。但是经过40天的一无所获，男孩的父母告诉他这个老人肯定是个倒霉鬼，最后也不会有好收获。男孩听从父母的命令，去了另一艘小船。第一个星期就捕到三尾好鱼。

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

看到老人每天两手空空的回来，男孩感到很悲伤。每每下去帮老人搬帆绳或者鱼叉和捕鲸叉还有卷在桅杆上的帆。帆用面粉袋子打着补丁，卷着，看起来像一个永远失败的白旗。

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.

老人消瘦而憔悴，脖子后面有深深折子。太阳通过热带海洋的强反射在他的脸颊上留下良性肿瘤的棕色斑点。

The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

斑点顺着他脸的两侧长下去。用绳索捕一些很重的鱼使他的手上有些深折痕的疤。疤痕没有新的，像没有鱼的沙漠侵蚀的那么久。

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.

他的眼睛与苍老的身体不同，与大海一样，湛蓝、乐观、顽强。

"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. "I could go with you again. We've made some money."

「圣地亚哥，」男孩说着与老人爬上了泊船的堤岸。「我又可以和你出海了，我们赚了些钱。」

The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.

老人教给男孩打渔，男孩爱他。

"No," the old man said. "You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them."

「别了。你在一艘幸运的船上，和他们待在一起吧。」老人答道。

"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks."

「别忘了之前你87天没捕到鱼，接下来三周我们每天都能捕到大鱼。

"I remember," the old man said. "I know you did not leave me because you doubted."

「我记得。」老人说到，「我知道你不是因为不相信我而走的。」

"It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him."

「是我爸爸让我走的。我只是个小孩我得听他的。」

"I know," the old man said. "It is quite normal." "He hasn't much faith." "No," the old man said. "But we have. Haven't we?" "Yes," the boy said. "Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we'll take the stuff home."

「我明白。」老人说，「这很正常。」「他没有信仰！」「没错，但是我们有，对吧？」「是的！」男孩回答，「我要请你去泰若思酒吧喝杯啤酒，然后我们这些东西搬回家。」

"Why not?" the old man said, "Between fishermen."

「何乐而不为？」老人说。「渔夫之间没什么好客气的。」

They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.

他们坐在酒吧露台上，许多渔民取笑老人然而他也没有生气。另外一些年长些的渔民看着老人，有些悲伤，却没有说出来。他们礼貌地谈论着近况和经历，曾经把鱼线漂流到多深的地方去，见过的连续好天气。
