>"What do you have to eat?" the boy asked. "A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?" "No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?" "No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold." "May I take the cast net?" "Of course."

「你家有什么吃的？」男孩问到。「一罐黄米和鱼，你要来点吗？」「不用了，我一会儿回家吃。你需要我把火生起来吗？」「不必了，过会儿我再弄。或者干脆我就吃凉的。」「我能拿着渔网走吗？」「当然可以。」

>There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.

其实并没有渔网，小男孩记得是什么时候他们把网卖了。不过他们每天都这么演一回。男孩也知道家里并没有那一罐黄米和鱼。

>"Eighty-five is a lucky number," the old man said. "How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?"
"I'll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?" "Yes. I have yesterday's paper and I will read the baseball."

「85是个幸运数字，」老人说。「你看我能不能回来一条大鱼，收拾干净，超过一千磅的？」「我去拿网捉沙丁。你能在门口晒太阳等我吗？」「行啊。我可以读读昨天报纸的棒球专栏。」

>The boy did not know whether yesterday's paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from under the bed. "Perico gave it to me at the bodega," he explained, "I'll be back when I have the sardines. I'll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you can tell me about the baseball."

男孩不知道昨天的报纸是不是也是假的。但是老人把它从床底下拿了出来。「柏里奥在杂货店给我的，」老人解释到。「我拿到沙丁就回来。我会把咱俩的鱼放在冰上，这样早上我们就能分享了。等我回来你给我讲讲棒球赛怎么样了。」

>"The Yankees cannot lose." "But I fear the Indians of Cleveland." "Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio." "I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.""Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago." "You study it and tell me when I come back."

「洋基队是不会输的。」「但是我有些担心克利夫兰的印第安人队。」「要对洋基队有信心，小子。想想我们有厉害的迪马吉奥。」「我害怕底特律老虎队和克利夫兰印第安人队。」「你先看着，等我回来告诉我。」

"Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day." "We can do that," the boy said. "But what about the eighty-seven of your great record?" "It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?" "I can order one." "One sheet. That's two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?" "That's easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half."
> 余：“你看，我们去买一张有八十五号码的连号彩票好吗？明天就是第八十五天了。”“好，”男孩说，“可是你八十七天的伟大记录呢？”“那是不会有两次的。你看你能找到一张八十五号的吗？”“我可以去订一张。”“一整张好了。一张是两块半。我们向谁去借呢？”“那容易。两块半我总借得到。”
>
> 张：「你想我们可要买一张彩票？尾数要它是八十五，明天是第八十五天。」「我们可以买，」孩子说。「但是你那八十七天的伟大的纪录呢？」「同样的事情不会发生两次的。你想你可以买到一个八十五吗？」「我可以定一张。」「一张。那是两块半钱。我们可以跟谁借呢？」「那很便当。我两块半钱总借得到的？」

"I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg." "Keep warm old man," the boy said. "Remember we are in September." "The month when the great fish come," the old man said. "Anyone can be a fisherman in May." "I go now for the sardines," the boy said.
> 余：“我想也许我一样借得到。可是我尽量不借。一次借。两次讨。”“盖暖些，老头子，”男孩说，“记住这是九月。”“这是大鱼来的月份，”老人说，“在五月里，谁都能做渔夫。”“现在我就捉沙丁鱼去了。”男孩说。
>
> 张：「我想我也许借得到。但是我总想避免借钱。先是借钱，后来就要讨饭了。」「老头子你穿得暖和点，」孩子说。「你要记得现在是九月了。」「正是大鱼来的月份，」老人说。「五月里是谁都可以做个渔夫，不稀奇的。」「我现在去拿沙汀鱼，」孩子说。

When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man's shoulders.They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward.
> 余：男孩回来时，老人已坐在椅上睡去，太阳也已落下。男孩从床上拿起旧军毯，铺在椅背上，盖着老人的两肩。他的两肩很怪，虽已垂老，却仍孔武有力；颈项也仍健壮，而且当他垂头睡着的时候，上面的皱纹也不很显著。

> 张：孩子回来的时候，老人坐在椅上睡熟了，太阳下去了。孩子把床上那条旧军毯拿起来，摊在椅背上，盖住老人的肩膀。是奇异的肩膀。虽然非常老了，仍旧壮健，颈项也强壮，老人睡熟的时候头向前倾，颈上的绉纹就没有那样明显。

His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun. The old man's head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted.

他的衬衫补过许多次，已经和那船帆相似；补过的地方也因日晒而褪成各种不同的色调。可是老人的头部已极苍老，只要闭上眼睛，脸上便毫无生气。报纸横摊在他的膝盖上，在傍晚的微风里给他的手臂压着。他赤着两脚。

> 张： 他的衬衫已经补过这么许多次，简直和那帆差不多了，补钉被太阳晒得褪成各种不同的颜色。但是老人的头部是非常衰老的，眼睛一闭着，脸上就没有生命。报纸摊在他的膝盖上，他的手臂把它压牢在那里，不被晚风吹去。他赤着脚。
