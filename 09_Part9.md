# The old man and the sea
## part9

>In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.

在夜色中老人感到天快亮了，划船时他听到飞鱼挣离水面的战栗声。它们挥动鱼翅发出嘶嘶声，飞向黑暗中。他非常喜欢飞鱼，这是他海上的主要伙伴。他为鸟儿们感到忧愁，尤其是那些纤小的黑色燕鸥，它们总是在飞啊、找啊，又总是找不到什么。他想：「这些鸟儿过得比我们还苦，当然除了那些强盗鸟和强壮的鸟们。」

>Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea. He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.

既然海洋是如此的残酷，为什么他们会造出想海燕这样纤细精致的鸟儿来呢？海洋本是善良而美丽的，但是她也会变得残酷，变得那么突然，那些低声悲吟、飞过海面点水觅食的的小鸟太纤弱了，是对付不了大海的。他总是把大海当做「la mar」，这是西班牙语中,人们对她的爱称。爱她的人有时也会说起她的不好，但总是把她说作一位女人。


>Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or witheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.

一些年轻的渔夫，那些用浮标做鱼线浮子，用鲨鱼肝能卖到的大价钱买来摩托艇的，称呼她为「el mar」，这是男性称呼了。他们说到她的时候，就像一个对手，一个地方，甚至是一个敌人。但是老人总是把她当做女性，可以施予或者不给恩惠。如果她做了邪魅狂娟的事情，是因为她控制不了。月亮影响了她就像影响了一个的女人，老人想到。

>He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swils of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour. I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them. Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.

他平稳地划着，并不吃力，因为速度保持的很好没有超过他均速，除了偶尔有一些湾流引起的漩涡，海面很平静。他让湾流助他三分之一的力气，天开始亮了，他看出此时已经划得比预计的远了。我在这「深井」上费了一个星期的劲儿还是一无所获，他想到。今天我要去柴鱼和金枪鱼的聚集地，哪里或许有大鱼。在天彻底亮之前，他把鱼饵投入水中，顺流而去。


One bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-gar-land on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could fell which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.





> 余：第一个饵入水四十英寻。第二个入水七十五英寻，第三第四两个却深沉蓝色的海水之中，各在一百及一百廿五英寻处。每个引饵都倒垂水中，钩柄藏在饵鱼腹内，系好缝牢，而鱼钩一切突出的部分，亦即钩弯和钩尖，都套上了新鲜的沙丁鱼。每条沙丁鱼都给钓钩贯穿两眼，在钢弯上形成了半圆形的花圈。钓钩上，大鱼所能接触到的部分莫不香甜可口。

> 张：一个饵放到四十噚下。第二个是七十五噚，第三第四个放在那蓝色的水里一百噚下，和一百二十五噚下。每一个饵都是头朝下，鈎子上直的一部分戳在作饵的鱼里，缚了起来，缝得牢牢的；鈎子突出的一部分──弯曲的部分，和尖子──完全盖满了新鲜的沙汀鱼。每一条沙汀鱼从两只眼睛里穿进去，它们穿在那铁钩上像半只花圈一样，在一条大鱼看来，这鈎子没有一部分不是香甜美味的。
