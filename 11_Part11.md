# The old man and the sea
## part11

>"Aqua mala," the man said. "You whore." From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny fish that were colored like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison. But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak ran give.

「水妖，」老人说，「你这婊子。」他轻轻摇桨，向水下望去，看到和那些毒线一样颜色的小鱼，游曳在线和它们漂起得气泡的阴影之中。它们对水母的毒素免疫。但是人类不能，当老人捕鱼时，有些水母丝会钩在绳索上又粘又紫，老人的胳膊和手上碰到就会红肿溃烂，像碰了毒藤毒橡树一样。

>But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash. The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.

但是这些「水妖」的毒素传播很快，那感觉像鞭子打在身上一样。这些五彩的气泡很美丽，却是海中最虚伪的东西，老人最喜欢看大海龟吃吞食它们。海龟看到气泡，便从前面靠近，然后闭上眼睛全身缩进壳里，把水母连须都吃掉。老人喜欢看海龟吃他们，也喜爱在暴风雨后践踏它们，听着它们在脚底老茧下压碎的声音。


>He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armor-plating, strange in their love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut. He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years. He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton.

他喜爱那些优雅、敏捷、名贵的绿绿和玳瑁，同时对那些巨大笨拙的红海龟有一种友善的轻蔑，轻蔑它们黄色的龟壳，古怪的求爱方式，闭着眼睛愉快的吃葡萄牙军舰水母的样子。尽管在捕龟船上工作多年，他对海龟没有任何迷信。只是怜悯，即便是像小船一样重达一顿的大背龟。

>Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle's heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish. He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it.

大部分人害怕捕龟，因为它被杀死切开后心脏还能跳动数个小时。但是老人不这样想，我也有一颗这样的心脏，我的手脚也像它们一样强壮。他吃白色的海龟蛋来补充力量。整个五月他都在吃海龟蛋，好在九月十月有力量对付真正的大鱼。他还每天去渔夫放装备的棚屋里，从大鼓里取一杯鲨鱼肝油喝。鱼肝油就放在那里，需要的渔夫都可以取。

>Most fishermen hated the taste but it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes. Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again. "He's found fish," he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the water.

大部分渔夫都讨厌这个味道。但是这还没有早起的时光难以难受。况且鱼肝油能够对付寒冷和流感还可以明目。此时老人仰视到鸟儿又开始盘旋。「他发现鱼了！」他大喊。没有飞鱼破水而出，鱼饵也没有分散。老人正望着，一条小吞拿鱼跃出水面，转动身体掉头钻入水中。
