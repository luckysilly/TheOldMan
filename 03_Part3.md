# The old man and the sea
## Part 3
>"Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light."

「我们划得远些风向换了再回来吧。我想在天亮前就出发。」

>"I'll try to get him to work far out," the boy said. "Then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid."

「我去试试劝他出个远航，」男孩说到。「那么如果你真的遇到大鱼，我们可以帮你。」

>"He does not like to work too far out." "No," the boy said. "But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin." "Are his eyes that bad?" "He is almost blind." "It is strange," the old man said. "He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes."

「他不太喜欢远航打渔啊。」「是啊，」男孩说。「我可以看到一些他看不到的东西，比如忙碌的小鸟，我还可以引他出海追海豚。」「他眼睛这么坏了？」「他几乎瞎了。」「奇怪啊，」老人说，「他从来不去捕龟，这是最伤眼的。」

>"But you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good." "I am a strange old man." "But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?" "I think so. And there are many tricks."

「但你就是常年在蚊子海岸捉龟，眼睛不也好好的。」「我可不是个一般的老人。」「但是你现在的身体足够应付一只厉害的大鱼吗？」「我觉得没问题。有很多窍门啊。」

>"Let us take the stuff home," the boy said. "So I can get the cast net and go after the sardines." They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft.

「我们把这些东西搬回家，」男孩说，「我好去拿渔网抓沙丁鱼。」他们从船上取下装备。老人肩扛着桅杆，男孩搬着装帆绳的木箱，那是棕色编成麻花的绳子，还有鱼叉鱼钩和鱼竿。

>The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.

装鱼饵的盒子放在船尾，贴着抓到大鱼时用来打鱼的棒子。没有人会从老人船上偷东西，但还是把帆和重绳搬回家比较好，因为露水会损坏它们。尽管老人确信本地人不会偷他的东西，但老人考虑到没有必要把鱼钩和鱼叉留在船里招人惦记。

>They walked up the road together to the old man's shack and went in through its open door.The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre.

他们一起走向老人的小屋，穿过敞开的门。老人把绕着帆的桅杆靠在墙上，男孩把盒子和其他家伙什放收在它旁边。桅杆和这棚屋的一室差不多长。棚屋是用被叫做「guano」的王棕的硬枝条做成的。屋里有一张床，一张桌子，一把椅子，脏地板上一处放了些木炭用来做饭。棕黄色的墙上是覆盖着一些扁平的棕榈叶，挂着一个彩色耶稣圣心像，还有科伯圣母像。

>These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.

这些都是他夫人的遗物。过去墙上曾经挂着他夫人的上色照片，但是老人把它取下来了，因为每次看到照片都使他感到孤独。老人把照片放在了角落柜子里干净衬衫下面。
