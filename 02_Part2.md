# The old man and the sea
## Part 2
>They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.

他们坐在泰若思平台上，许多渔民拿老人找乐子，但他并没有生气。另外一些年长些的渔夫看着老人，为他难过，却没有说出来。他们礼貌地谈论着洋流，投索的深度，稳定的好天气，和其他见闻。

>The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.

当天收获的渔夫已经进港，他们把杀好的马林鱼搬出来摊摆满了两块木板。两个男人一头一个，蹒跚着把木板搬到渔库，等着冷运车来把鱼运到哈瓦那的市场。捕到鲨鱼的渔夫则把它们送到海湾对面的加工厂，用滑轮组吊起来处理。去掉肝脏，剪下鱼翅，扒下鱼皮，把鱼肉切成一条条的准备撒盐腌制。


>When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbor from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odor because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.

起东风的时候，港口里飘满了鲨鱼工厂吹来的腥味。但是今天只有一点淡淡的味道，因为风转向北吹，逐渐停息，平台上明媚宜人。



>"Santiago," the boy said. "Yes," the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago. "Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?" "No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net." "I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way."

「圣地亚哥，」男孩唤到。
「诶。」老人应声。他正端着玻璃杯追忆往昔。
「我去帮你弄些沙丁鱼明天用，好吗？」
「算了，你去打棒球吧。我还划得动船，罗格里奥可以撒网。」
「我要去。如果我不能帮你捕鱼，我也要帮点别的忙。」

>"You bought me a beer," the old man said. "You are already a man." "How old was I when you first took me in a boat?" "Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?"

「你请我喝啤酒了，」老人说，「你已经是个男子汉了。」
「你第一次带我上船时我多大来着？」
「5岁，那次你差点丢了小命，还记得吗？我没遛够就太早把一条鱼拖上船，它力气足得差点把船撞碎了。」

>"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me."

「我记得它的尾巴拍来拍去的，坐板也撞断了，我还记得你用桨敲鱼发出的那动静。你把我推向船头，我栽到湿漉漉的盘线里，觉得整个船都在震动。你敲那鱼发出的声音像把树砍倒了一样。我全身溅满了那鱼鲜血的甜腻味道。」

>"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?" "I remember everything from when we first went together." The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes. "If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble," he said. "But you are your father's and your mother's and you are in a lucky boat."

「你是真的能记得当时的情景，还是后来我给你讲的？」
「自从我们第一次一起出航，每件事情我都记得。」
老人用他日晒、充满信任与慈爱的眼睛注视着男孩。
「如果你是我的孩子，我就带你去赌一把。」他说，「可是你是你父母的小孩，现在又跟了一艘走运的船。」

>"May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too." "I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box." "Let me get four fresh ones."

「让我去弄些沙丁鱼来吧，我还知道哪里可以弄到4个鱼饵来着。」
「今天我自己还有剩下的，腌到盒子里了。」
「让我去弄4条新鲜的吧。」

>"One," the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises. "Two," the boy said. "Two," the old man agreed. "You didn't steal them?" "I would," the boy said. "But I bought these."

「1条就行了。」老人说到，他从来没有失去过希望和信心。现在更是振作一新，如同微风兴起。
「带2条吧。」男孩说道。
「2条，可以。」老人同意。“「你不是偷来的吧？」
「我倒想，」男孩说到，「是我买的。」


>"Thank you," the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride. "Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current," he said. "Where are you going?" the boy asked.

「那谢啦。」老人说到。老人心思单纯，还有没考虑是什么时候变得如此谦逊。但是他知道自己已经变得谦逊，这不失品格，也无损自尊。
「看这潮水，明天会是个好天。」他说。
「你要去哪儿？」男孩问到。
