"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked. "We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some." They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. "How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep. "Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today." "So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."
> 余：“你要喝咖啡吗？”男孩问道。“我们先把这些东西放在船上，再去喝。”他们到专做渔人生意的早食店里，用炼乳罐头盛咖啡喝。“你睡得好吗，老头子？”男孩问道。虽然打断睡眠，仍感不适，他现在总算渐渐地醒过来了。“好极了，曼诺林，”老人说，“我今天觉得很有把握。”“我也是的，”男孩说，“现在我得去拿你和我的沙丁鱼，还有你的新饵。他总是自己拿我们的东西。他从来不要别人拿。”

> 张：「你要喝咖啡么？」孩子问。「我们把工具放在船上，再去喝咖啡。」他们到一个大清早做渔夫们生意的地方，用听头炼乳的洋铁罐喝咖啡。「老头子你睡得怎么样？」孩子问。他现在渐渐醒过来了，但是他仍旧很难摆脱睡意。「我睡得很好，玛诺林，」老人说。「今天我很有信心。」「我也有，」孩子说。「现在我得去拿你同我的沙汀鱼，还有你的新鲜的饵。我们的工具他自己带来。他从来不要别人帮着拿什么。」

"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." "I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.
> 余：“我们可就不同，”老人说，“你才五岁，我就让你拿东西了。”“我记得，”男孩说，“我马上就回来。再喝一杯咖啡吧。我们可以记账。”他赤脚踩着珊瑚岩，向藏饵的冰屋走去。老人缓缓地饮着咖啡。一天就吃这些了，他知道非吃不行。近来他久已不甘饮食，也从来不带午餐。他在船头藏水一瓶，一整天就够了。

> 张：「我们是两样的，」老人说。「你才五岁的时候，我就让你拿着东西。」「我知道，」孩子说。「我马上就回来。再喝杯咖啡。我们在这里可以赊赈的。」他走开了，赤着脚踏在珊瑚石上，走到冰房里去，饵贮藏在那里。老人慢慢地喝他的咖啡。他一天就吃这么点东西，他知道他应当吃掉它。他久已对吃喝感到厌倦了，现在他出去从来不带午饭。他有一瓶水放在船头上，除此以外他这一整天什么都不需要了。

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water. "Good luck old man." "Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.

> 余：这时男孩已经带着沙丁鱼和报纸包着的两饵回来。两人踩着夹有卵石的沙地，顺着小径，走到船边，把船抬起，推下海去。“一帆风顺，老头子。”“一帆风顺。”老人说。他把桨索在桡座的护圈上系牢，借着桨面拨水之势，向前俯倾身子，便在昏暗中划出了港口。

> 张：孩子现在拿了沙汀鱼回来了，还有那两个饵，包在报纸里，他们沿着路下去，向小船走去，他们可以觉得脚下底踏着沙，沙里嵌着石子，他们把小船抬起来，让它溜到水里去。「老头子，祝你运气好。」「祝你运气好，」老人说。把他桨上缚着的绳子套在船边的桨架上；桨在水里一戳，他的身子就向前一冲，他开始划到海港外面去了，在黑暗中。

There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills. Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.

> 余：别的渔船从别处沙岸出海；虽然现在月落山后，看不见他们，老人却听得见他们木桨起落之声。间或有人在船上说话。可是大半的渔船，除了桨儿拨水，再无声响。出了港口，他们便四面散开，各人向自己有望捕鱼的洋面划去。老人知道自己要去远海，他把陆地的气息抛在背后，划进了大洋早晨清新的气息。

> 张：月亮已经落到山背后去了，别处的海滩上另有别的船出发到海中去，老人虽然看不见他们，却可以听见他们的桨落到水里和推动的声音。有时候有一只船上有人说话。但是这些船大都是静默的，只有桨落在水里的声音。他们出了海湾口外就散布开来了，每人都向海洋里他希望能够找到鱼的地方划去。老人知道他是要到海口外很远的地方去，他把土地的气味丢在后面，划出去，划到清晨的海洋的气息中。

He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.

> 余：他划过渔人所谓深井的洋面，看到水里“湾草”磷磷闪光；该处海床陡降七百英寻，湾流撞在海底的峭壁上，形成漩涡，所以各种鱼类都在此汇集。这儿最深的底洞里，潜藏着成千成万的虾子和饵鱼，间或还有成群的鱿鱼；夜间它们升近了海面，给顺流游过的大鱼吞去。

> 张：他看见墨西哥湾海草在水中发出燐光，那时候他正划到海上，渔夫们称为「大井」的地方，因为那里突然深至七百噚，各种鱼类聚集在那里，因为潮流冲到海底的削壁上，激起了漩涡。许多虾集中在这里，还有那种可以作饵的鱼，最深的洞里有时候有一群群的乌贼鱼，它们晚上升上来，离海面很近，一切漫游的鱼都吞吃它们。
