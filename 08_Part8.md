>"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked. "We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some." They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. "How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep. "Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today." "So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."

「你想喝咖啡吗？」男孩问到，「我们把家伙放到船上就可以去喝点。」他们在清晨渔民专供点用炼乳罐子喝了咖啡。「睡得怎么样，老头子？」男孩问。他已经清醒了，尽管困意消得很难。「很好啊，马诺林，」老人回答，「我今天很有信心。」「我也是，」男孩说，「现在我要去给你拿咱俩的沙丁还有你的鱼饵。他把我们的装备带来，他从不让别人搬东西。」

>"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." "I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.

「我们可不一样，」老人说。「你5岁的时候我就然你搬东西了。」「我知道，」男孩回答，「我会回来的。再来一杯咖啡吧，我们在那可以记账。」他光着脚在珊瑚岩上走开了，去存鱼饵的冰屋。老人慢慢的喝了咖啡。这是他全天唯一能找的吃的了，他知道应该喝了它。很长时间以来，他觉得吃饭很麻烦，从来都不带午饭。他在小船里放了一瓶水，这就是他全天的供给了。

>The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water. "Good luck old man." "Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.

男孩带着用报纸卷着的沙丁鱼和两条新鱼饵回来了，他们向小船走去，感受着脚下鹅卵石的触感。他们将小船抬起，滑入水中。「一帆风顺，老头子。」「祝我好运。」老人说，他把用绳索将船桨在桨架上绑好，身子前倾使劲将船破开水的阻力，在黑暗中划出港口。

>There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills. Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.

还有一些船从其他海岸出海了;尽管月亮淹没在群山之中看不到他们，老人听到他们的浆扎入海中划动的声音。有时传来船上有人说话的声音，但是大多数船都沉默前行，只听得的船桨破浪的声音。船只从港口出来就各自扬镳远航驶向他们认为会有鱼的地方。老人知道他已经驶离海岸很远，陆地的味道也闻不到了，使劲划向有着清晨清新味道的大海。

>He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.

当他划过被渔人称作深井的海域时，看到水中的马尾藻发出闪闪磷光。这里突然变深七百英寻，洋流撞在海床的陡壁上产生的旋涡聚集各种的鱼。在这最深的洞里藏着大量的虾子和铒鱼，有时还有成群的鱿鱼，它们晚上升近水面，被巡游的鱼吃掉了。
