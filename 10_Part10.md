# The old man and the sea
## part10

>The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness.

男孩给了他两条新鲜的小吞拿鱼，或者是青花鱼，就像铅锤挂在那两条潜的最深的鱼线上。其他鱼线上还有一条蓝色大鱼和黄花鱼，之前用过，但是依然状况很好，填上新鲜的沙丁鱼后散发出诱人的美味。

>Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line. Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise. The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and *well in toward*
 the shore, spread out across the current.

每条鱼线都像一只大铅笔那样粗，捆在一个树脂棒上，只有有鱼上钩或者碰到鱼饵棒子就会下沉。每条鱼线都有两盘四十英寻的线圈，可以快速延上其他备线。在必要情况下，一条鱼能拖出三百英寻的鱼线。此时，老人在盯着小船一侧三个木棒的沉浮，轻轻地划着船保持鱼线垂直落在合适的深度。天色已经十分亮了，太阳随时要升起来。太阳从海面稀薄的升起，老人可以看到别的船贴着水面，*他们朝着海岸*，穿过洋流分散开来。

>Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.

然后天空越来越亮，光线照在水面上。随着太阳升起光线越来越清晰，海平面把光线反射回他的眼睛里，非常的刺眼。他继续划船不去直视阳光。他向水下看去，鱼线笔直的垂到水下的黑暗里。他比任何人都把鱼线保持的笔直。在洋流内的每一个深度，都按照老人的愿望精准地布置了鱼饵等着鱼儿游过。其他人只是让鱼饵随波逐流，有时他们觉得鱼饵有一百英寻了，实际却只有六十英寻。

>But, he thought, I keep them with precision.Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore. All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.

但是，他想，我把鱼饵保持的最精准。只是我没有运气吗？谁又知道呢，也需今天运气就来了。每一天都是全新的。幸运当然是更好的，但是我宁愿准确。这样运气来的时候你才是准备好的。太阳已经升起两小时了，向东望去不那样刺眼了。目之所及只有三条船贴着水面，远在靠岸的那侧。清晨的阳光刺了我一辈子，他想。不过眼睛还是很好用。晚上我可以直视太阳，眼里也不会有黑影。落日的光线更强，但是早上的阳光就是刺痛。

>Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again. "He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking." He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.

就在这时他看见一只军舰鸟，挥着黑色的长翅膀在他前方的天空盘旋。鸟儿突然斜拉了尾翼向下俯冲，然后又开始盘旋。「它一定抓到了什么」，老人高声说，「它可不是看看而已。」他缓慢而平稳地向鸟儿盘旋处划去。他不慌不忙保持鱼线垂上垂下。他划得比洋流快一点点，尽管为了利用鸟儿寻鱼比平时捕鱼划得还要快一些，这样还是可以精准捕鱼。


>The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then be dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface. "Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin." He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow.

鸟儿向空中高飞一些，停下翅膀再次盘旋。然后它突然向水下潜去，老人看到飞鱼从水中刺出，拼命地游过水面。
「海豚，」老人大喊。「大海豚。」
他放好桨，从船头下面取出一条小鱼线，上面有条引线和一个中号钩子。他把钩子装上沙丁鱼饵，投入船的一侧，将线系在船尾的环栓上。然后他把另一条线也放上饵，卷好放在船头的阴影里面。



>He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water. As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphins were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped.

再回身划船观察长翼黑鸟贴着水面捕食。当他看着鸟儿再次斜过翅膀向下冲刺，然后使劲挥动翅膀追逐飞鱼却徒劳无功。老人看到水面微微隆起，大海豚浮出，追着四散的飞鱼。海豚跟着鱼儿的轨迹破浪冲刺，追逐着鱼儿掉落的位置。



>It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast. He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.

这是一大群海豚，他想。它们遍布四周，飞鱼根本没有机会逃脱。鸟儿也没有机会捕食。飞鱼对鸟儿来说体格太庞大速度也太快。他看到飞鱼一次一次冲出水面，鸟儿徒劳无功。那群海豚游走了，老人想。它们游得又快又远。但是我或许能捡个落单的，可能我的大鱼就在它们里面。我的大鱼一定在某个地方。

>The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish.

云彩像山峦一样从陆地上升起，海岸线变得只有一道绿色的线，后面藏着蓝灰色的山丘。海水现在变成了深蓝色，深的几乎发紫.他向下望进水中，看到了红色浮游生物在深色水中飘着，阳光折射出奇怪的光线。他观察这他的鱼线，看着它们笔直的垂下去消失在视线中，垂入水中。他很高兴看到这么多浮游生物，这意味着有鱼了。

>The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man of war floating close beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.

太阳在水中折射出的奇怪的光线，现在太阳又升高了，和陆地上云彩的形状一样预示着好天气。但是鸟儿几乎已经看不到了，水面上只有一些黄色的，太阳晒褪色的马尾藻海草，船周漂浮着紫色的有毒的荧光鼓着胶囊般浮囊的葡萄牙军舰水母。它转向一侧，然后又自己翻个身。它快乐的漂浮着，就像一只气泡拖着一条长长的紫色毒线，在水中拖了有一码远。
