# The old man and the sea
## part12

>The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were circling it and driving it. If they don't travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.

这条吞拿鱼在太阳下闪着银光，在它落入水中后一条又一条的鱼儿跃出水面飞向四面八方，翻腾水面大跳追赶鱼饵，绕着它追。要不是它们游得太快，我可以划到它们中间去，老人想到；他望着它们将水翻起白色浪花，鸟儿此时也俯冲向因为恐慌窜出水面的饵鱼。


>"The bird is a great help," the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna's shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat.

「鸟儿可帮了大忙，」老人说到。说着船尾的钓索在他脚下打好绳圈处拉紧了。他放下浆感受着小吞拿的拉力，握紧绳索开始拽。鱼的拉力越拽越大。他到鱼儿的蓝色背鳍露出水面，还有金色的两侧，然后把鱼溜过船舷，拽进船舱。

>He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern. "Albacore," he said aloud. "He'll make a beautiful bait. He'll weigh ten pounds." He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself.

它躺在船尾的阳光里，结实的身体呈子弹型。它那无神的大眼睛闪烁着，整洁的尾巴激剧的颤抖拍打着船板。出于人道，老人敲了鱼头，然后踢了它，它的身体依然在在船尾的阴影里颤抖。「青花鱼，」老人高声说，「这可是好饵料，它大概有十磅。」他记不得什么时候开始喜欢大声的自言自语。

>He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always considered it so and respected it.

过去他一个人的时候经常唱歌，有时晚上独自掌舵渔船或者捕龟船他都会唱歌。很可能是小男孩离开后，他一个人才开始大声自言自语，反正他也记不清了。和小男孩一起捕鱼时，他们通常在必要时才交谈。他们只在夜里或者被暴风雨困住才讲话。在海上不讲废话被视为一种美德，老人也一直这么认为并且遵守它。

>But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy. "If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy," he said aloud. "But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the baseball." Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding.

但是现在没有旁人会被打扰，老人就多次大声说出自己的想法。「如果别人听到我大声自言自语，会以为我疯了吧。」他大声说。「反正我又没疯，我才不在乎。有钱人的船上有收音机对他们讲话，还能播报棒球赛的消息。」现在可没有时间考虑棒球，他想到。现在只能琢磨一件事，我为此而生的事。那群鱼里可能有条大家伙。我刚才只是捡到一条贪吃落单的。
